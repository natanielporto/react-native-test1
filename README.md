# react-native-test1

This is a project to create a simple functionality of randomizing the background when you press the main (and only) button.

I assume that you have the React-Native cli and Android Studio already installed. If not, please do so.

Start your emulator first. This was created for the Google Pixel 3a.

To run it, clone the project, use "yarn" or "npm i" on the root folder of the app to install all the dependencies. 

After the installation, inside the root folder, in one terminal type: npx react-native start.
On another terminal, inside the same folder, type: yarn start or npm start.
